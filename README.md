[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/song940/node-dns.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/song940/node-dns)

> A DNS Server and Client Implementation in Pure JavaScript with no dependencies.

### Features

+ Server and Client
+ Lot of Type Supported
+ Extremely lightweight
+ DNS over UDP, TCP, HTTPS Supported

### Installation

```bash
$ npm install dns2
```

### DNS Client (default UDP)

Lookup any records available for the domain `lsong.org`. 
DNS client will use UDP by default.

```js
const DNS = require('dns2');

const dns = new DNS();

(async () => {
  const result = await dns.resolveA('google.com');
  console.log(result.answers);
})();
```

Another way to instanciate dns2 UDP Client:

```js
const { UDPClient } = require('../..');

const resolve = UDPClient();

(async () => {
  const response = await resolve('google.com')
  console.log(response.answers);
})();
```

### DNS Client (TCP)

Lookup any records available for the domain `lsong.org`. By default, DNS requests will use UDP.

```js
const { TCPClient } = require('../..');

const resolve = TCPClient();

(async () => {
  const result = await dns.resolveA('google.com');
  console.log(result.answers);
})();
```

### Custom DNS Server

You can pass your own DNS Server.

```js
const { TCPClient } = require('../..');

const resolve = TCPClient({
  dns: '1.1.1.1'
});

(async () => {
  const result = await dns.resolveA('google.com');
  console.log(result.answers);
})();
```

### System DNS Server

You can use the first DNS server from your OS with native node dns.

```js
const dns = require('dns');
const { TCPClient } = require('../..');

const resolve = TCPClient({
  dns: dns.getServers()[0]
});

(async () => {
  const result = await dns.resolveA('google.com');
  console.log(result.answers);
})();
```

### Example Server

```js
const dns = require('..');

const { Packet } = dns;

const server = dns.createUDPServer((request, send, rinfo) => {
  const response = Packet.createResponseFromRequest(request);
  const [ question ] = request.questions;
  const { name } = question;
  response.answers.push({
    name,
    type: Packet.TYPE.A,
    class: Packet.CLASS.IN,
    ttl: 300,
    address: '8.8.8.8'
  });
  send(response);
});

server.on('request', (request, response, rinfo) => {
  console.log(request.header.id, request.questions[0]);
});

server.listen(5333);
```

Then you can test your DNS server:

```bash
$ dig @127.0.0.1 -p5333 lsong.org
```

Note that when implementing your own lookups, the contents of the query
will be found in `request.questions[0].name`.
